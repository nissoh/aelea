# Aelea Performance Benchmark Report

## Recent Optimizations (2025)

### Stream Implementation Refactoring

1. **Migration from Factory Functions to Stream Classes**
   - Eliminated `stream` factory function overhead by implementing direct Stream classes
   - Examples: `Periodic`, `Motion`, `Component`, `At`, `MapStream`, etc.
   - Benefits: Better debugging, reduced function call overhead, more efficient instantiation

2. **PropagateTask Optimization**
   - Removed unnecessary scheduler parameter from task functions
   - Eliminated `stepTask`/`recurTask` in favor of direct PropagateTask usage
   - Result: Cleaner API and reduced memory allocations

3. **Periodic Stream Micro-optimizations**
   - Removed state object in favor of individual variables
   - Eliminated null checks by using `disposeNone`
   - Used `propagateRunTask` instead of `propagateRunEventTask` where appropriate

4. **Motion Combinator Optimization**
   - Moved `dt` constant to class level (avoid recreating each frame)
   - Created dedicated `Motion` Stream class
   - Removed method call overhead by inlining where appropriate

5. **Component Stream Class**
   - Replaced `stream` factory with dedicated `Component` class
   - Better type safety with explicit generic parameters

These optimizations build upon the previous scheduler improvements that resulted in a **10.5x performance improvement** for switch operations.

**Aelea-specific Advanced Scenarios**:
- **Merge** (100 streams × 100 items): 19,170 ops/s - Handles massive parallelism
- **Combine** (3 streams × 100 items): 204,561 ops/s - Good synchronization performance
- **Zip** (3 streams × 100 items): 78,327 ops/s - Buffering impacts performance

**Key Insights**:
- **@most/core** demonstrates superior performance across all combinators:
  - Zip operations (102-136% faster)
  - Combine operations (100-117% faster)
  - Merge operations (41-72% faster)
- **Aelea** maintains consistent low variance and predictable performance
- Both libraries scale well with increased stream counts
- The optimized Node.js scheduler significantly improves Aelea's performance

### Map Fusion Test

Map fusion automatically combines multiple map operations into a single operation:

```typescript
// These four maps should be fused into one operation
map(x => x + 1)
map(x => x * 2)  
map(x => x / 3)
map(x => x - 4)
```

**Results**:
- Correctness: ✅ Verified
- Fusion Status: ❌ Not implemented (no symbol markers detected)
- 10,000 items performance:
  - Direct loop: 0.29ms
  - Stream processing: 0.85ms (2.93x overhead)

The overhead indicates that map fusion is not yet implemented in Aelea, presenting an opportunity for future optimization.
